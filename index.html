<h1>Cricket The Game of Gentlemen</h1>
<p> Cricket is a dynamic and strategic sport played between two teams of eleven players. It revolves around batting, bowling, and fielding, with the goal of scoring more runs than the opposing team. Matches can range from fast-paced Twenty20 games to longer formats like Test cricket, which span five days. The game is played on a circular field with a rectangular pitch at the center, where bowlers deliver the ball and batsmen aim to hit it effectively. Popular in countries like India, England, Australia, and Pakistan, cricket fosters teamwork, precision, and endurance, making it one of the most beloved sports worldwide. </p>
